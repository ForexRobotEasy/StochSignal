# StochSignal Expert Advisor

This is an Expert Advisor (EA) called StochSignal that utilizes the Stochastic Indicator to generate trade signals in the MetaTrader 5 (MT5) platform.

## About the Expert Advisor

The StochSignal EA is developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team and can be found on their website [forexroboteasy.com](https://forexroboteasy.com/forex-robot-review/stochsignal-review-optimizing-forex-trades-with-stochastic-indicator/). Please note that ForexRobotEasy is not the official developer of this product. We are only providing a sample code that can work as described in this product.

The StochSignal EA is designed to optimize forex trades using the Stochastic Indicator. It generates trade signals based on the comparison between the main line and the signal line of the Stochastic Indicator. When the main line is above the signal line, a buy signal is generated, and when the main line is below the signal line, a sell signal is generated.
